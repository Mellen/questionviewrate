# Question View Rate

## Introduction

As a moderator on the English Language and Usage Stack Exchange website, I occassionally want to know if the number of views a question is getting is accellerating very quickly or if it has stagnated. This collection of scripts forms a service that allows questions to be added and removed from observation and publishes the results to a web page.

### Note

This is **not** an official Stack Exchange tool. I am not an employee of Stack Exchange. I am one of their many many volunteer moderators, but I cannot speak on their behalf, only my own.
